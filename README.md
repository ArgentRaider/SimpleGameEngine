# SimpleGameEngine

A simple game engine for Computer Graphics homework, based on [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) tutorials.

(It seems the website for tutorials is blocked in China now, so you may visit [LearnOpenGL CN](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io) for Chinese version.)



### Needed libraries

- [GLFW](www.glfw.org/download.html)
- [GLAD](http://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
- [Assimp](http://assimp.org/main_downloads.html)

All needed .lib and .dll files are already built in the project directory but it is suggested to built them on your own platform. 



### More

I really don't know how to organize my codes and project well, so any help and suggestions will be welcome!
